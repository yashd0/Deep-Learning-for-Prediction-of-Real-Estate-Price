# Outcome 

In this project, we will predict home sale prices in King County in the U.S. between May, 2014 and May, 2015 using several features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, view, and square footage. This  project is practical and directly applicable to the real estate industry. You can add this project to your portfolio of projects which is essential for your next job interview
